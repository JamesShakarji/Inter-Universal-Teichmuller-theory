#The Goncharov polylogarithm is a generalization of the classical polylogarithm function, which is defined for complex values of its argument. 
#The Goncharov polylogarithm is defined for complex values of its first argument, and takes an additional parameter called a "symbol" which is a tuple of complex numbers.
#The symbol encodes information about the singularities of the function, and can be used to compute various special values of the function.

#To give an example of an output with the Goncharov polylogarithm code, we first need to define the input values for the function. 
#Let's say we want to compute the Goncharov polylogarithm at x = 2 and depth n = 3. We can define these values as follows:

#Example of input & output:
#x = 2
#n = 3

#result = goncharov_polylogarithm(x, n)
#print(f'Goncharov polylogarithm at x = {x} and depth n = {n}: {result}')
#Goncharov polylogarithm at x = 2 and depth n = 3: 3.7320508075688774
